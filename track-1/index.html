      somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond
      any experience,your eyes have their silence:
      in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
      or which i cannot touch because they are too near
      
      your slightest look easily will unclose me
      though i have closed myself as fingers,
      you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
      (touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose
      
      or if your wish be to close me,i and
      my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,
      as when the heart of this flower imagines
      the snow carefully everywhere descending;
